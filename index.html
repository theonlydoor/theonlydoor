<p>Do you know where you will spend eternity? If you are unsure, there is good news! The Bible tells
    us how we can know for sure that we will spend eternity in Heaven.
    Take a look at what Godâ€™s word says.</p>

<h2>We have all sinned</h2>
<p>Sin separates us from God. Because of sin, we do not deserve to go to Heaven. <span class="scriptureReference">Romans 3:10</span> says,
    "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Romans 3:23</span> - "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God".</p>

<h2>The penalty for sin is death</h2>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Romans 6:23</span> begins, "For the wages of sin <span class="italic">is</span> death".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Romans 5:12</span> - "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
    and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span> - "In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that
    obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Revelation 20:15</span> - "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
    into the lake of fire".</p>

<h2>Jesus died for your sins</h2>
<p>Jesus died on the cross, paying the price for our sins. He was buried, and rose again after three days. Because of what Jesus did, we can have everlasting life.
    <span class="scriptureReference">Romans 6:23</span> continues "but the gift of God <span class="italic">is</span> eternal life through Jesus Christ
    our Lord".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Romans 5:8</span> - "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
    Christ died for us".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</span> - "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
    how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and
    that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures".</p>

<h2>Receive Jesus as your Savior</h2>
<p>Going to church and doing good works, while they are good things to do,
    will not get you to Heaven. It is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone.
    <span class="scriptureReference">John 3:16</span> says, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
    begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Romans 10:13</span> - "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Acts 16:31</span> - "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">John 14:6</span> - "Jesus saith unto him, <span class="red-text">I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
    unto the Father, but by me</span>".</p>
<p>In <span class="scriptureReference">John 6:40</span> Jesus says, "<span class="red-text">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
    the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day</span>".</p>
<p><span class="scriptureReference">Ephesians 2:8-9</span> - "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: <span class="italic">it is</span> the gift of God: Not of works,
    lest any man should boast.".</p>

<p>Do you believe in your heart that Jesus died on the cross and rose again? That He paid the
    penalty for your sins, so you can have everlasting life? Do you believe there is nothing you
    can do on your own to earn salvation, but it is all in what Jesus has already done? If you do, ask Him to save you.
    You can say a prayer like this:</p>

<div class="prayer">
    <p>Lord,</p>
    <p>I know that I am a sinner. I believe that Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again. I believe
    that Jesus paid the price for my sins.
    I believe salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus alone, and not any works that I could ever do.
    Forgive me of my sins, and save me. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
</div>
